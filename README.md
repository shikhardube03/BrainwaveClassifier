# BrainwaveClassifier

This is a final project group project for my Neural Network Modeling class. This code is used to create a brainwave classifier that when fed with EEG data. 
This basic classifier has applications for people with disabilites who can make facial movements to interact with their enviornments using an EEG and 
adapted implementation.
