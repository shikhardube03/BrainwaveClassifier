# BrainwaveClassifier

This project that aims to classify facial movements using EEG data. EEG or electroencephalography is a non-invasive method of recording brain activity by measuring electrical signals from the scalp. By analyzing the EEG data, BrainwaveClassifier can detect patterns of brain activity that correspond to specific facial movements.This technology has many applications for people with disabilities who may have difficulty communicating through traditional means. By pairing BrainwaveClassifier with BLE-enabled devices, individuals with disabilities can use their facial movements to control various devices such as a computer or a wheelchair. This technology can also be used in virtual reality applications to provide a more immersive experience by allowing users to control their avatars through facial movements.The potential impact of BrainwaveClassifier is significant, as it has the potential to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities by providing them with more accessible means of communication and control. Additionally, this technology can have applications in fields such as gaming, virtual reality, and robotics, where facial movement control can enhance user experience and interaction.
